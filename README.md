# bisqwitportal-gba
Implementation of Bisqwit's Portal engine on the GBA (two versions, in different states)

# Building
Install devKitPro and `make`

# The demo ROM
After the "pmprog" logo pops up and down, the `A` and `B` buttons will launch two different versions of the portal renderer.
One has massive graphical glitches, and struggles to move the player around, I think this was the version I had started to rewrite
The other works fine, which I think was an almost direct port of Bisqwit's code
